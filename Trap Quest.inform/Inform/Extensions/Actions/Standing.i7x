	[
	Summary of standing mechanics:
	If your fatigue is greater than strength times 15 (modified by body soreness where soreness 1 is 100% and soreness 10 is 10%), you fall over.
	If your fatigue is greater than strength times 13 (same modification), you can't even attempt to stand.
	The player rolls their standing capability against the standing challenge.
	
	While struggling to stand, you can probably crawl.
	Unless your weight count is greater than your strength plus 5, you will be able to try and crawl.
