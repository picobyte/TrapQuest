Visibility by Clothing begins here.


Clothing can be layer-exposing or layer-concealing.  Clothing is usually layer-concealing. [Clothing that is layer-exposing is cut in such a way that a viewer can always see glimpses of the layer underneath.  Clothing that is layer-concealing never does this.  Clothing that has a special rule should redefine the definition block below.  This is about the CUT and SHAPE of the item, and not transparency.  Transparency is checked for separately.  A see through raincoat would still be layer-concealing.]

Definition: a clothing (called C) is top-layer-concealing:
	if C is worn and C is layer-concealing and the top-layer of C > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is mid-layer-concealing:
	if C is worn and C is layer-concealing and the mid-layer of C > 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is bottom-layer-concealing:
	if C is worn and C is layer-concealing and the bottom-layer of C > 0 and (C is total protection or C is skirt-covering-crotch) and C is crotch-normal, decide yes; [crotch-assless clothing doesn't hide what's underneath]
	decide no.

current-clothing is a thing that varies.

Definition: a thing (called C) is currently perceivable:
	if C is carried, decide yes;
	if C is currently visible, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a thing (called C) is currently visible:
	decide no.

Definition: a wearthing (called C) is currently visible: [Is the item worn and currently visible to onlookers?]
	if C is not worn, decide no;
	if the concealer of C is clothing, decide no;
	decide yes.

Definition: a wearthing (called C) is currently covered: [Is the item worn and covered by another item (so protected from liquids and magic dust and lasers)]
	if C is not worn, decide no;
	if the coverer of C is clothing, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a wearthing (called C) is currently uncovered:
	if C is not worn, decide no;
	if C is currently covered:
		decide no;
	decide yes.

[Layers, not visibility.  Mesh items don't count as covering at all since liquid can get through]
To decide which object is the coverer of (C - a clothing):
	if the top-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through top-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the top-layer of O > the top-layer of C and O is not mesh:
				decide on O;
	if the mid-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through mid-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the mid-layer of O > the mid-layer of C and O is not mesh:
				decide on O;
	if the bottom-layer of C > 0 or C is chastity cage or C is condom of kings:
		repeat with O running through bottom-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the bottom-layer of O > the bottom-layer of C and O is not mesh:
				decide on O;
	decide on nothing.

[Layers + visibility]
To decide which object is the concealer of (C - a clothing):
	if the top-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through actually dense top-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the top-layer of O > the top-layer of C:
				decide on O;
		decide on nothing; [Top is uncovered]
	if the mid-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through actually dense mid-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the mid-layer of O > the mid-layer of C:
				decide on O;
		decide on nothing;  [Mid is uncovered]
	if the bottom-layer of C > 0 or C is condom of kings:
		if C is pussy protection:
			repeat with O running through worn potentially vagina covering clothing:
				if O is not C and the bottom-layer of O > the bottom-layer of C or O is actually dense skirted clothing:
					decide on O;
		otherwise:
			repeat with O running through worn potentially asshole covering clothing:
				if O is not C and the bottom-layer of O > the bottom-layer of C or O is actually dense skirted clothing:
					decide on O;
	decide on nothing.

To decide which object is the concealer of (K - a diaper):
	repeat with C running through worn potentially asshole covering clothing:
		if (C is knee-length or (C is short and the player is not prone)) and C is crotch-in-place, decide on C; [only skirts can hide diapers, everything else it's still clear what you're wearing.]
	decide on nothing.

To decide which object is the concealer of (S - a sex toy):
	repeat with O running through worn actually dense clothing:
		if S is penetrating asshole:
			if O is potentially asshole covering clothing, decide on O;
		if S is penetrating vagina:
			if O is potentially vagina covering clothing, decide on O;
	decide on nothing.
